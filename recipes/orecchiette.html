        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is for the butternut squash lover. It was inspired by a pasta dish that I had at an Italian restaurant in Charlottesville called Tavola (which is outstanding if you are ever in the area). Their version had less butternut squash and a little more cream. I love butternut squash, but if you don't have the same mild obsession that I do, only roast the squash and add it at the very end so it retains it shape. I love this dish both ways.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large butternut squash, cut into small cubes, divided</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 red onion, sliced thinly</li>
            <li>1/2 pound orecchiette</li>
            <li>1 or 2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth, divided</li>
            <li>1 bunch kale</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 ounce goat cheese, optional</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425Â° F. Toss all but 1 cup of the butternut squash with 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, pepper, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and the nutmeg. Roast until butternut squash pieces are tender and caramelized, about 30 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saucepan over low heat. Cook sliced red onions until caramelized, about 30 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a pot of water over high heat until boiling. Salt water generously. Cook orecchiette according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat another tablespoon of olive oil in a heavy pan over medium-high heat. Cook the remaining cup of butternut squash for approximately 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Add 1/2 cup of the chicken broth and cook until broth is almost completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>Remove the middle stems from the kale and roughly chop the leaves. Add kale to butternut squash and stir until kale has softened. Add caramelized red onions.</li>
            <li>Add white wine and cook for 2 minutes. Add remaining chicken broth and reduce, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn heat to low and add the heavy cream. When the pasta is al dente, add it to the pan with the sauce. Add the roasted butternut squash.</li>
            <li>Loosen sauce with pasta water if needed. Sprinkle with goat cheese (optional), sage, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
