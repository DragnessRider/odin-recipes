        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I don't know what the origin of this cake is, but I got the recipe years ago from a neighbor, who didn't know where it originated from either. If any of you readers out there have heard of this cake and have any idea of its origin—please let me know! In any event, this is seriously the easiest, moistest cake I have ever made and, despite its simplicity, I have received the most compliments and requests for this recipe over any others. The taste of this delicious bundt has been compared to honey, or honey cruellers. I like to serve this cake drizzled with a simple maple icing but to be honest the cake really doesn't need anything! It is absolutely delicious and makes an excellent coffee-time treat or a light after-dinner dessert. I have even served it to my kids for breakfast with a little maple syrup—it is just that versatile.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h2>The cake</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Maple drizzle</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons maple extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk, plus more as needed to yield a thin icing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350° F and grease your bundt pan.</li>
            <li>Into a batter bowl, add the 1 1/4 cups sugar, flour and baking powder and give it a quick stir with a fork to mix. In another bowl, whisk the eggs and water until smooth. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and whisk until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the greased bundt pan and bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick tests done.</li>
            <li>As soon as you take the cake out of the oven, pour the heavy cream into a glass measure and add the butter and the 2 tablespoons sugar. Heat this in the microwave until it is very hot but not boiling. Stir cream mixture and slowly pour it over the hot bundt cake. (It will seem like a lot, but it will all absorb!). Let sit for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the cream has absorbed but before the cake cools completely gently loosen the edges by sliding a small spatula between the cake and the pan in a few spots. Invert the pan onto a serving plate and release the cake.</li>
            <li>Let cool completely. At this point you can serve the cake as it is (you won't believe how moist it is!) or you can drizzle with a but of icing, below.</li>
            <li>For maple drizzle, whisk all ingredients together until smooth, adding milk a teaspoon at a time until desired consistency is reached. Drizzle over cake.</li>
        </ol>
